# Day 8

## Challange #1

Table: Products

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |


product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
 

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

### Example 1:

***Input:***   
Products table:

| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |

***Output:***   

| product_id  |
|-------------|
| 1           |
| 3           |

***Explanation:***  Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.


## Solution 
```mysql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'
```

## Challange #2

Table: Customer

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |

In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
 

Find the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customer table:

| id | name | referee_id |
|----|------|------------|
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |

Output: 

| name |
|------|
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |


## Solution 

```mysql
SELECT name
FROM Customer 
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL
```

## Challange #3

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
| area        | int     |
| population  | int     |
| gdp         | bigint  |

name is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.
 

A country is big if:

it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example:

Input: 
World table:

| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |

| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |

Output: 

| name        | population | area    |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |

## Solution 

```mysql
SELECT name ,population, area 
FROM World 
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000
```


## Challange #4

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |

There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table, the table may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
 

Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Views table:

| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |

Output: 

| id   |
|------|
| 4    |
| 7    |

## Solution

```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT author_id as id 
FROM Views 
WHERE author_id = viewer_id 
ORDER BY id ASC
```


## Challange #5

Table: Employees


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the name of an employee in a company.
 

Table: EmployeeUNI


| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| id            | int     |
| unique_id     | int     |

(id, unique_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the corresponding unique id of an employee in the company.
 

Write a solution to show the unique ID of each user, If a user does not have a unique ID replace just show null.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:

| id | name     |
|----|----------|
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |

EmployeeUNI table:

| id | unique_id |
|----|-----------|
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |

Output: 

| unique_id | name     |
|-----------|----------|
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |

Explanation: 
Alice and Bob do not have a unique ID, We will show null instead.
The unique ID of Meir is 2.
The unique ID of Winston is 3.
The unique ID of Jonathan is 1.

## Solution 

```mysql
SELECT EmployeeUNI.unique_id, Employees.name
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI
ON Employees.id = EmployeeUNI.id;
```
