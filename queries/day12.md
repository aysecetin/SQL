## Challange:  Confirmation RateðŸ’»


**Table: Signups**

| Column Name    | Type     |
|----------------|----------|
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |

- user_id is the column of unique values for this table.
- Each row contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.
 

**Table: Confirmations**

| Column Name    | Type     |
|----------------|----------|
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
| action         | ENUM     |

- (user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
- user_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Signups table.
- action is an ENUM (category) of the type ('confirmed', 'timeout')
- Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').
 
**Question:**

**The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0. Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.*

**Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.*

**Return the result table in any order.*

**The result format is in the following example.*

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 
-------------
**Signups table:**

| user_id | time_stamp          |
|---------|---------------------|
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 |
| 7       | 2020-01-04 13:57:59 |
| 2       | 2020-07-29 23:09:44 |
| 6       | 2020-12-09 10:39:37 |

**Confirmations table:**

| user_id | time_stamp          | action    |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:30:46 | timeout   |
| 3       | 2021-07-14 14:00:00 | timeout   |
| 7       | 2021-06-12 11:57:29 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-13 12:58:28 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-14 13:59:27 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-02-28 23:59:59 | timeout   |

**Output:**
-----------------
| user_id | confirmation_rate |
|---------|-------------------|
| 6       | 0.00              |
| 3       | 0.00              |
| 7       | 1.00              |
| 2       | 0.50              |


**Explanation:**
User 6 did not request any confirmation messages. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 3 made 2 requests and both timed out. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 7 made 3 requests and all were confirmed. The confirmation rate is 1.
User 2 made 2 requests where one was confirmed and the other timed out. The confirmation rate is 1 / 2 = 0.5.

## Solution

```mysql
WITH user_confirmations AS (
    SELECT
        s.user_id,
        COUNT(c.user_id) AS total_actions,
        SUM(CASE WHEN c.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS confirmed_actions
    FROM Signups s
    LEFT JOIN Confirmations c
    ON s.user_id = c.user_id
    GROUP BY s.user_id
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    ROUND(CASE 
            WHEN total_actions = 0 THEN 0
            ELSE confirmed_actions * 1.0 / total_actions 
          END, 2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM user_confirmations;
```

_Explanation:_
_**WITH user_confirmations AS (...:**  This common table expression (CTE) calculates the total number of confirmation actions (total_actions) and the number of confirmed actions (confirmed_actions) for each user._

_**LEFT JOIN:**  We use a LEFT JOIN to ensure that all users from the Signups table are included, even if they don't have any entries in the Confirmations table._

_**SUM(CASE WHEN c.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END):**  This counts how many of the user's confirmation actions were 'confirmed'._

_**ROUND(..., 2):**  The result is rounded to two decimal places._

_**CASE WHEN total_actions = 0 THEN 0:**  If the user has no confirmation actions (i.e., total_actions is 0), we set the confirmation rate to 0._
