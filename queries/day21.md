### Problem

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

- Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.  
- Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.  
- Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.  
- Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.  


**Input Format**

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

| Column | Type    |
|--------|---------|
| A      | Integer |
| B      | Integer |
| C      | Integer |


**Sample Output**

|  A  |  B  |  C  |
|-----|-----|-----|
|  20 | 20  | 23  |
|  20 | 20  | 20  |
|  20 | 21  | 22  |
|  13 | 14  | 30  |
